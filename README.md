# Biodiversity: studying factors that affect the trend

## Applying time-series ARIMA to predict the curve until it hits less than 50% loss

* This project aims to give a general overview of what impacts the biodiversity on the planet, passing through the visual study on the quantity of earth-planet each country needs to feed its economy. Then shifting to the global warming issue correlated to the increase of CO2 through a map+tooltip study and lastly analyzing the territory focusing on seeing the level of forest and land for measure.
* Given these inputs, this analysis applies the ARIMA method for time series to forecast the trend of the curve using data from 2001 to 2021.

** Inside of data you will find:
* 'aggregate_extintion_measure' used for the analysis in Python
** 3 outputs obtained from prev_biodivers.ipynb (ARIMA_forecast_world, avg_cou_biod_2021_RLI, bounded_predictions_2100) 
*** Other spreadsheets used for visualization for correlated factors of analysis
